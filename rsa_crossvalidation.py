# python script cross-validating the results of the rsa performed by rsa.py

# script trains classifier on the stimulation data and tests classifier on the imagery data
# if classifier performs good, neural representations of tactile stimulation and imagery are probably similiar

# OR: leave-one-out (subject or trial?)

# TODO: decide on cross-validation method & perform cross-validation

# SETUP
# imported formatted_data from rsa.py script with the following dimensions:

#       3rd dimension: 79 voxels
#       4th dimension: 6 conditions/stimulus types
#       5th dimension: 10 participants
